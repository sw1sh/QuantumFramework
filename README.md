[The Wolfram Quantum Framework](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/Wolfram/QuantumFramework/) brings a broad, coherent design for quantum computation, together with a host of leading-edge capabilities, and full integration into Mathematica and Wolfram Language. Starting from discrete quantum mechanics, the Framework provides a high-level symbolic representation of quantum basis, states, and operations. The Framework can perform measurements and is equipped with various well-known states and operations, such as Bell states, multiplexers and quantum channels. Using such simulation capabilities, one can use the Framework to model and simulate quantum circuits and algorithms.
